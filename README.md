# Pangolin Service Starter ðŸ¦”

Pangolin is a tool that sits on a port and, when receiving an HTTP request, will start a process.

It's designed for off-by-default services that only need to boot up when you access them -- think, for example, your
checklist application or document manager.

Let's say you have a compute-intensive service that only needs to run when you access it. It's supposed to run on **port 3000**, so you start Pangolin to sit on the port:

```bash
pangolin 3000 node example-service.js
```

When you make the first HTTP request to 127.0.0.1:3000, Pangolin will temporarily redirect you to a holding page, and start the application (freeing up the port). Afterwards, Pangolin will forward you to the started application.

Pangolin doesn't act as a proxy for any of the requests to the actual service, making it **zero-overhead** once the application is started.

Because Pangolin doesn't start all applications eagerly, you can use it to have more services deployed on low-end machines (e.g. a Raspberry Pi), even if all running services together would exceed the resources available on the system (like RAM or CPU).

In a way, it's a much simplified version of systemd's [Socket Activation](https://0pointer.de/blog/projects/socket-activated-containers.html). Unlike systemd, Pangolin doesn't require your application to accept open sockets from an external system, though.
That means you can use Pangolin with applications and frameworks that don't have builtin support for socket activation.

## TODO
- [ ] Provide a mode for APIs that either indicates to [retry the request in a little while](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17862015/http-statuscode-to-retry-same-request), or uses temporary redirects to put the request in a "holding pattern" while the service is starting up. 
- [ ] (optional) Health-check the service. If the service doesn't require liveness anymore, ask it to shut down
  gracefully.
- [ ] (optional) When available, bind the port again.
